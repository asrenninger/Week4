# MUSA 650: Machine Learning in Remote Sensing

## Week4: Data Representation and Unsupervised Learning

This repository contains:

- [Introduction to satellite image analysis with Python, DSTL challenge](PrjA1_DSTL_ImgChannelsMasks.ipynb)
- [A first machine learning application using Satellite imaging, DSTL challenge](PrjB3_DSTL_Clustering.ipynb)
- [Image clustering, Philadelphia](PrjB4_Sentinel_Clustering.ipynb)


### Access to colab notebooks and datasets:

You can run this week's satellite imaging notebooks on "Google Colab"

Steps for replicating "PrjA1_DSTL_ImgChannelsMasks.ipynb" :

- Copy shared datasets in a google drive folder named as "PrjData"
- Go to Google Colab, copy the Jupyter notebook there (or copy it in your Google Drive, click on it and select "open in Colab")
- Run the notebook
